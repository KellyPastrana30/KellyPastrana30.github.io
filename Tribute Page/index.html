                Kobe Bryant was a legendary basketball player who spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was a five-time NBA champion, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, and an 18-time NBA All-Star. He was known for his incredible work ethic, his competitive spirit, and his ability to score in a variety of ways. He was also a devoted husband and father, and his tragic death in a helicopter crash in 2020 shocked the world.
